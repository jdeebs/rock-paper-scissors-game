This is my a project I'm making from scratch for The Odin Project. Here I will include my Pseudocode to outline my thought process for completing the project.

Rock Paper Scissors:

Create variables for userChoice and computerChoice.

Prompt userChoice for choice of rock, paper, or scissors.

Have computerChoice randomly choose between rock, paper, or scissors.

If choices are rock and scissors, rock wins.

If choices are rock and paper, paper wins.

If choices are paper and scissors, scissors win.

If choices are equal display "You Tied!", If win condition is true display "You Win!". If lose condition is true display "You Lose!". All conditions will ask the user to play again.
